Hello! My name is Ben Coleman, and I'm a developer, cloudy tech guy and all round technology geek.

I've rattled around the tech industry for over 25 years doing a lot of different things, I've worked on mainframes, built monitoring systems for telcos, and was around for the birth of cloud. These days I work at Microsoft as an engineering manager helping people develop and build applications in the cloud 

I blog on a range tech topics such as coding/dev, cloud, containers, DevOps, Kubernetes etc. but I can be anything that captures my imagination

I live in London with my wife and cats, I spend my time doing stuff like running, making electronic music, gaming and of course; coding :)

In the unlikely event of you wanting to know a bit more, here's my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles:
