This winged, scaly bastard has sat unpainted on my shelf mocking me for over 4 years. I’d finished painting the rest of the game years ago, but never could face painting this guy. Well now consider him slain with the mighty airbrush. <br>There was definitely a lot more I could have done here, more shading on the scales & wings etc, but really, I didn’t care to bother. This was a quick n’ dirty job just to get him done. The airbrush made fairly short work of him, leaving some of the smaller, fiddly details to pick out. Not overly pleased with the end result, but it feels good to have him completed after all these years
