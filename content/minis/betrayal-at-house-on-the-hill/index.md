Finished repainting the ‘Betrayal At House On The Hill’ figures. They come pre-painted but really, really badly. I thought I’d have a “quick” go at re-touching them, and this is the result. Obviously they are not the greatest sculpts in the world but the end result is better than I expected.

[For reference this is what they look like out of the box](http://legacy-control.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_20141118_201923015.jpg)
