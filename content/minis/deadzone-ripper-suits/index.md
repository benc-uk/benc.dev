Wow. These guys took **forever,** literally months (elapsed) to complete. I really lost my painting mojo as they took so long. I’ve not painted models so packed with tiny details before. I have to admit I don’t like the poses, they seem really goofy IMO, and all the stupid looking guns and blades make them look childish. 

Anyhow, I’m mega relieved to have these off my painting desk. Only a few more to complete the Marauder faction
