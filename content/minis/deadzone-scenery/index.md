After backing the Deadzone kickstarter I have a mountain of Deadzone scenery sprues piled up, crying out to be started on. So I’ve tackled just 4 of the sprues in order to experiment with what looks the best.
 
Primed with Army Painter grey - results very good, very matte and drys fast. Recommended stuff. For the shading wash I tried a couple of things; one was Army Painter Quickshade in “darktone”, this came out very well, it settles nicely into the recessed areas and drys consistently. The other thing I tried was a good old fashioned mix of paint/ink & water - results: HORRIBLE! 

I had a little flow-aid in my mix and that resulted in the stuff drying in the most crappy way possible, with the dark areas in the exact opposite places to where I wanted them! Even with no flow-aid in the mix the results were similarly terrible. It’s going to be Quickshade all the way for this, only snag is I’m going to need a <em><strong>lot</strong></em> of the stuff to do all the scenery, time to buy one of those big tins.

For the highlighting it was a single pass of light/mid-grey grey drybrushed with a very dry mix. It’s going to ruin the brush by the time I complete everything but there’s nothing I can do. I think it looks pretty good. The photo makes it look a little more shiny and mottled than it really is - that’s just a side effect of the flash.
Only 26 more sprues to go :’(
