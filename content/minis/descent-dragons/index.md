Another foray with the airbrush. I wanted a dark shadowy purple so left the black undercoat showing as my shading. It was hard to get purple to look as vibrant as I wanted over the black, so I ended up with some extra highlights which are a bit lilac-ish. Not an especially good paint job, but I utterly despise painting dragons so I just wanted them done and gone. Special mention goes to the spines which were so badly moulded and ruined with irremovable bits of flash, so they look awful. Anyhow thatâ€™s it Descent 2nd Edition fully painted!
