Very strange models combining all four elements into a single piece. I used the airbrush to apply base colour to the yellow and lower blue areas, with a small amount of masking required. This gave me a very flat nice base coat. In the end the fire didn’t work out quite as well as I hoped it would. I’m still not sure if the middle part should be water or more fire. Oh well I think they’ll look good on the board
