Bought these punks at Salute, they are from Wargames Foundry’s “Street Violence” range but I thought they look perfect for using in the new Judge Dredd Miniatures Game. They were metal and really nice sculpts, easy & fun to paint. I went to town with the different colours and experimented with a few skin tone differences. These perps look ready to terrorise the citizens of Mega City 1
