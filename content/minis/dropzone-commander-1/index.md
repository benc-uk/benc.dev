I’m back (not that anyone visits the site to have even noticed!). I picked up the Dropzone Commander starter box the other week at Salute, and I’ve been keen to start on the Scourge stuff. They looked pretty quick and easy to paint - and they are. Lots of drybrushing to bring out all the details, then I used the airbrush to add the patches of blue colour. Pick out a few other details and you’re done!
