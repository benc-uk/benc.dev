My warband for Frostgrave is taking shape. The wizard I posted previously, the other guys are all Reaper Bones. Cloaked dude (lady?) is going to be the apprentice wizard, the bald guy is a Barbarian and the other either a knight or Templar. Can’t say I’m impressed with the Bones sculpts or the quality of the models. Ok so they are cheap but they are such poor quality. Had a nightmare with the skin & muscles on the Barbarian, he looks shit, I know - but I lost the will to live, he’ll have to do. The Templar came out pretty clumsy looking mainly due to how crap the plastic is on Bones models. Yay :(
