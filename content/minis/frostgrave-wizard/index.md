Put a lot of effort into this guy. Nice metal sculpt with clean detailing from Reaper. I wanted him to be fairly flamboyant and colourful, not a drab looking wizard. In hindsight, I might have gone a little too far, and ended up with him looking garish and a little “fabulous”. Oh well. The cloak I blended from blue at the top through to purple at the bottom, which seemed like a nice idea until it came to shading which was a nightmare. Trying to deal with the colour changing on two axis’ at once was a challenge. Face & eyes were a problem too, and not the best I can do, but had to leave it as I was getting into “making things worse” territory. Anyhow, pretty pleased with the overall result
