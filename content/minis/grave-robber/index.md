This is a Reaper Bones grave robber given to me by a friend, for my Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay character. 

My first ever attempt at object-source-lighting, with me trying to show the glowing light coming off his lantern cast onto his face and body. Not sure I’ve really pulled it off that well, and god it was a lot of faff. I wasn’t keen on the skulls on the lamp, as they seemed a bit OTT. Still I think I’m happy with the result.
