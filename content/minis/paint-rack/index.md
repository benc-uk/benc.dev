New paint rack holder type thingy is here. Wonderful, however I’m now going to waste the rest of my life arranging them in different configurations and orders. By color, by type, by manufacturer, by pot shape. Argh! 
It’s from [Miniaturicum](http://www.miniaturicum.de/index.php?infoBox=3&cPath=723&sort=4a&language=en) a German site, but they post all over Europe.
