As this blog is testament to, I've not painted for a loooong time. I didn't do any painting in 2016 & 2017, and I focused my hobby time on music & synthy stuff. 

However I picked up [Games Workshop's Shadespire](https://warhammerunderworlds.com/) (or more correctly *Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire*) last weekend. I'm not fan of the company, as they have really lost their way but... this game looked interesting, cheap(ish) and simple to play. It comes with 8 models for two warbands. After clipping the models together (no glue!!) I really fancied get the brushes out again and doing some painting.

So here we are. I've started painting the "Bloodreavers", which if it were 1993 I would have called Chaos Thugs of Khorne, but now everything has a new name in the Warhammer world. The models are surprisingly restrained by modern Games Workshop standards, with only a handful of skulls and spikes. The physical quality of the sculpts is extremely good; no mold lines & very crisp details making them fun to paint. 

I've got 5 of these guys to do, but I wanted to complete one to see what they'd come out like, especially after a 2Â½ year break from painting. He came out OK, a bit messy in places & didn't do the best work on the highlighting but good enough for the table.  
Good to be back :)
