I've finished the first warband from the Shadespire box, the Bloodreavers.  

As you can see this merry bunch like nothing more than showing off their pecs and waving their axes about, while shouting. Truth be told I don't know much about them, I suppose I could read the fluff that came with the rules. Anyhow they were a decent way to get back into painting, detailed without being fiddly and no really tricky parts. 

I followed the colour scheme of the [Games Workshop painted ones](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2017/10/11/the-warbands-of-shadespire-garreks-reaversgw-homepage-post-2/) pretty closely, all reds, blacks, bronze and metal - a classic combo, but one that always looks good

I'm pretty happy with them, some of the flesh shading is pretty ropey, along with the highlighting on the black trousers not going brilliantly. I'm sure they'll look OK on the board
