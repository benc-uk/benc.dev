A friend of mine asked me to paint a model for him, which was his *D&D* character; a Warlock. I'm not into commission work but I'm more than happy to do a one off for a friend

The model is from the [*Reaper Bones*](http://www.reapermini.com/Miniatures/Bones) line, so that means poor quality, soft plastic. It wasn't the worst *Reaper* model I've painted, but the lack of fine detail in places and annoyingly placed mould lines make the job harder than it should have been.

I did like the pose/sculpt which is definitely a fun nod to Tim the Enchanter from Monty Python. Not much to say about the paint job really, the bones/horns are scruffier than I would have liked but lack of fine detail on the model held me back. There was a nice big open book, so I did put the effort in to make it look suitably spellbooky and mystical, filled with runes and pentagrams
