Bit of a mixed bag, some of the models had nice ideas but let down buy the soft plastic sculpts FFG used for Wiz War (it’s fair enough, as it’s not really a game that is focused on the minis). Got fed up by the last guy (the gnome) and did a quick “speed paint” job on him. Tried to make the golem look like his insides were hot coals, not really sure it worked.
