Not super pleased with these guys, not sure why they were a struggle but they were. The yellow guy in particular is a mess and looks awful, I had a nightmare with the yellow paint and actually had to strip him and start over. Green wizard came out ok, I think. Anyhow they are good enough for a silly board game like Wiz War
