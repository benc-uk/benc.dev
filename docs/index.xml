      <description>Load Testing. Not the coolest of subjects these days, you could argue, but one close to my heart. Back in 2004 I joined a software company called Mercury, at the time well know for a load testing product called LoadRunner.
For a while my career was very focused on measuring &amp;amp; reporting application performance in various ways. Fifteen years later and the whole industry has changed and evolved, load testing has slipped from the limelight; however people still obviously care about the performance of their web apps, so it has never gone away.</description>

      <description>I currently help maintain a site called Azure Citadel, which is host to lots of techie articles, guides, labs and things related to Azure
Azure Citadel is in part is a big reason why this blog has been dead for 12 months, as the majority of my technical writing ended up there rather than as blog posts. Sorry!
We recently did a complete overhaul of the Azure Citadel site and part of this was to improve the search solution we had.</description>

      <description>Hello! My name is Ben Coleman, and I&#39;m a developer, cloudy tech guy and all round technology geek.
I&#39;ve rattled around the tech industry for over 20 years doing a lot of different things, I&#39;ve worked on mainframes, built monitoring systems for telcos, and was around for the birth of cloud. These days I work at Microsoft helping people use the cloud to build &amp;amp; design new applications and cloud-native capabilities.</description>
