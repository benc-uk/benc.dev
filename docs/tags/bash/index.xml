      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found using Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL) in the last two years has transformed how I use my Windows machine for development and general tech &amp;amp; cloud work. The new Terminal has further cemented this new reliance on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like I&#39;m not alone, lots of people seem very interested in the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/terminal&#34;&gt;Windows Terminal&lt;/a&gt; and also how to use it with WSL. I&#39;ve just been though the process of a fresh setup of the new Terminal &amp;amp; WSL from scratch, so I figured it was a good time to write up how I set it up and use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already written about WSL v2 in a previous post, and as it&#39;s still a bit experimental it&#39;s probably worth ignoring for now. With that in mind everything I&#39;ll run through will assume you&#39;re setting up &amp;amp; using WSL v1 just to keep it simple (for now). I&#39;m going to keep thing pretty to the point and factual as much a possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
