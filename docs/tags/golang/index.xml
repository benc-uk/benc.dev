      <description>I&#39;ve dabbled with the Go programming language in the past, and came away with mixed feelings. However I&#39;ve resolved to a have an extra &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; language to go alongside JavaScript/Node and Python (with C#, Java and PHP being long consigned to the &amp;ldquo;only if I must bucket&amp;rdquo;), so decided to revisit Go and get some real usage of the language under my belt. In addition some recent tooling changes means it has become a lot easier to work with, so it was time for a second look.</description>
