      <description>I currently help maintain a site called Azure Citadel, which is host to lots of techie articles, guides, labs and things related to Azure
Azure Citadel is in part is a big reason why this blog has been dead for 12 months, as the majority of my technical writing ended up there rather than as blog posts. Sorry!
We recently did a complete overhaul of the Azure Citadel site and part of this was to improve the search solution we had.</description>
