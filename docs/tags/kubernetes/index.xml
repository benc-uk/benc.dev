      <description>I&#39;ve built up a small collection of simple containered web apps in a number of languages/frameworks over the last couple of years which I use for my demos. I use these especially with Azure and with Kubernetes, when I need &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; to deploy and run
I was in the process of moving these all over to Kubernetes (deployed though Helm and GitHub Actions) when I took a look at them all running side by side.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working on this one for a long time, but I think it&#39;s finally ready for the world.
Kubernetes is a huge topic and I wanted to condense down my learnings over the past 12 months, into some digestible &amp;amp; re-usable form, so I created another of my tech primers.
This goes fairly deep and is designed for a technical audience, so is much more than a quick overview of Kubernetes (altogether there is some of that).</description>
