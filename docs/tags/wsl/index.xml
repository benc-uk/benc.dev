      <description>I&#39;ve been a huge fan of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) since it first came to Windows 10. In fact it&#39;s fair to say it has completely transformed how I do local development, run tools and my whole workflow. Naturally I was very interested in the news from Build announcing a new version of WSL, which seems to go by the rather functional (if descriptive) name &amp;ldquo;WSL2&amp;rdquo;
I&#39;m not going to get too deep into what&#39;s new and exciting with WSL2, as I think the announcement blog covers it nicely</description>
