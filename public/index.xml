      <description>Load Testing. Not the coolest of subjects these days, you could argue, but one close to my heart. Back in 2004 I joined a software company called Mercury, at the time well know for a load testing product called LoadRunner.
For a while my career was very focused on measuring &amp;amp; reporting application performance in various ways. Fifteen years later and the whole industry has changed and evolved, load testing has slipped from the limelight; however people still obviously care about the performance of their web apps, so it has never gone away.</description>

      <description>I currently help maintain a site called Azure Citadel, which is host to lots of techie articles, guides, labs and things related to Azure
Azure Citadel is in part is a big reason why this blog has been dead for 12 months, as the majority of my technical writing ended up there rather than as blog posts. Sorry!
We recently did a complete overhaul of the Azure Citadel site and part of this was to improve the search solution we had.</description>
