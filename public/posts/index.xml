      <description>Load Testing. Not the coolest of subjects these days, you could argue, but one close to my heart. Back in 2004 I joined a software company called Mercury, at the time well know for a load testing product called LoadRunner.
For a while my career was very focused on measuring &amp;amp; reporting application performance in various ways. Fifteen years later and the whole industry has changed and evolved, load testing has slipped from the limelight; however people still obviously care about the performance of their web apps, so it has never gone away.</description>
